Write in detail how to train a GAN model for image to image Generation
write the the main item and its names in 1 line like 
\item 'X'  encoded as Solid , Ground
write a code to import an image in latex
I  want you to write 3 paragraphs to include the following :
What type of data is used to train GAN models for image to image generation. The second paragraph should tell that i explored the web and collected data from different github repository and finally the final paragraph should tell that i encoded the variables using different symbols and using their ASCII values
Write in some detailed terms for data collection of mario game levels from the internet
can you list down any dataset that can be used to train video game environments using GANS 
I want you to write an introduction for my research paper on the following topic :
"Generative models for New Video Game Environments"
It should be descriptive .
Now, I want you to write in detail how we can use Diffusion for the same process
Now, in the same manner, i want you to write how we can use GANs for this purpose
While VAEs offer exciting possibilities for procedural content
I am basically writing a latex document. So i want you to also include some equations using the latex format please . It would be a great help
Now I want you to Explain How VAE's Can be used for Procederal Content Generation especially for Game Environments .
Can you make it more longer please
I want you to write an introduction for my research paper on the following topic : "Generative models for New Video Game Environments" It should be descriptive .
